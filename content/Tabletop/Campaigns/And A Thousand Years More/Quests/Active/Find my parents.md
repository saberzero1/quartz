Desperate to unearth the truth, I set out on a mission to discover what happened to my beloved parents and bring justice to those responsible. I was determined to find out why they were taken from me. My heart was set ablaze with a fiery passion to uncover the truthr. I traveled far and wide, gathering clues and evidence, following every lead until I had the answers I sought. I would not rest until the one responsible was brought to justice, no matter the cost.
