The Skunk Coachman was a cowardly figure. He had a penchant for transporting travelers from Opeden to Narre, and, on this fateful day, had the honor of ferrying a group of brave adventurers who had just emerged victorious from a fierce battle against the Bandits who had threatened to hijack his cart. With a determined glint in his eye, the Skunk Coachman expertly guided his trusty steed towards the distant horizon, leaving the broken remains of the Bandits in the dust.

## Description

- Skunk Coachman.
- Taxied us from Opeden to Narre after we defeated the Bandits that threatened his cart.
