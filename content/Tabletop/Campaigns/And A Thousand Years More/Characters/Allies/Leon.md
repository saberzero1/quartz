The Skunk Coachman was a cowardly figure. He had a penchant for transporting travelers from [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden\|Opeden]] to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]], and, on this fateful day, had the honor of ferrying [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|a group of brave adventurers]] who had just [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Bandits\|emerged victorious from a fierce battle]] against the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|Bandits]] who had threatened to hijack his cart. With a determined glint in his eye, the Skunk Coachman expertly guided his trusty steed towards the distant horizon, leaving the broken remains of the Bandits in the dust.
