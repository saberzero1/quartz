---

- The evening falls.
- As we walk through the busy streets, I manage to hear that the keizer is in the city. He will give a speech tomorrow near the temple of the druids/luthers. The locals don't like. We also learn about the fall of the Cogniscenti. We also hear the keizer's family's location. We learn that he is near the docks.
- I decide to read my father's letter.
- It is a manuscript. The keizer is already dead for a millenial. The current stand in is my younger brother. It contains proof of this.
