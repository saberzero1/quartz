- [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|We]] head over to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Guild Building\|Guild building]]. #Faction #Location #Event
- "Names and reasons for visit please" the secretary states as we enter.
- "[[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|We]] have come to return something" [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] say as I put down the Blue level quest [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] took earlier. #Character #Faction #Event
- The secretary gives me a glare. "Which [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|one of your ravens]] is the one responsible for this?" #Character #Event
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] point towards [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]]. "This one, he has come to apologize fo-" #Character #Event
- The secretary interrupts me "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|He]] is demoted to a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Green Level Guild Badge\|Green badge]]. Anything else I can do for you?" #Character #Item #Event
- I pause for a second "That's all."
- "Next!" The [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Hildegart\|secretary]] screams as [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|we]] leave the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre/Wizard Tower\|building]]. #Character #Faction #Location #Event

- [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|We]] are traveling with [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|Leon]]'s cart towards [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]]. #Character #Faction #Location #Event
- "Hey Aleksi," I say. "Can you tell me more about Narre?"
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|Aleksi]] grabs his lute "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]] is a place of divide. Between [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Narre/Mages of Narre\|menacing Mages]] and [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Narre/Miners of Narre\|many Miners]]. Rich and poor living under one name but divided by the north and the south." #Character #Faction #Location #Event
- I nod. "Anything else we should know?"
- "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|I]] heard there is a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Wildt/Wildt's Fair\|fair]] in [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Wildt\|Wildt]] in a few weeks. [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party]] might want to check it out." #Character #Faction #Location #Event
- I nod.
- "Oh!" [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|Aleksi]] continues "Remember that [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Clear the Sky Moss\|Sky Moss]]? I heard it is stuck to a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre/Wizard Tower\|tower in Narre]]." #Character #Location #Quest #Event
- "Maybe [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|we]] can help them clear it!" [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] say with a smile #Character #Faction #Event .
- "For a price." [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] remarks. #Character #Event
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] nods in agreement. "For a price." #Character #Event

- On [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|our]] way to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]] we pass along a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre/Narre's Keep\|keep]]. It seems well guarded. #Faction #Location #Event
- "I wonder what they are guarding." I say.
- "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Narre/Keep Guards of Narre\|They]] aren't exactly guarding something." [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|Leon]] says. #Character #Faction #Event
- I give Leon a confused look.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|Leon]] grins "It's a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre/Narre's Keep\|prison]] my [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|dear]], try not to get stuck there." #Character #Faction #Event

- [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|We]] arrive in [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]]. As [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|Aleksi]] told us, the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Clear the Sky Moss\|Sky Moss]] is stuck to a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre/Wizard Tower\|big black tower]] in the middle of [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]]. #Faction #Character #Quest #Location #Event
- [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|We]] head towards the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre/Wizard Tower\|tower]]. Upon entering we a greeted by a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Hildegart\|big gorilla]]. #Faction #Character #Location #Event
- "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|Master Ekhart]] is not available for visits. Now please leave." The [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Hildegart\|gorilla]] states as she looks down upon [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|us]]. #Character #Faction #Event
- I gulp. "Uhm… We're adventurers… And we…"
- "Adventurers?" The gorilla interrupts.
- "Yes…" [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] mumble as I show my [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Red Level Guild Badge\|Red badge]]. #Character #Item #Event
- "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|Master Eckart]] will be here in a second." #Character #Event

- A few minutes later a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|robed figure]] arrives from upstairs. #Character #Event
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] wave. "Hi. You must be [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|Master Eckart]]." #Character #Event
- The figure nods. "I'm [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|Master Eckart]], the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Narre/Mages of Narre\|Head wizard]] of [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]]." #Character #Faction #Location #Event
- "I'm Lux." I say. "We're wondering if-"
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|Eckart]] interrupts [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|me]]. "You're [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Hornwaldia Adventurer's Guild\|adventurers]], looking for [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Clear the Sky Moss\|quests]], [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Red Level Guild Badge\|Red badge level]]…[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Green Level Guild Badge\|mostly]]" as he gives [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] a look. #Character #Faction #Quest #Item #Event
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] look at [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|the figure]] with surprised eyes. "How did you do that?" #Character #Event
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|Master Eckart]] laughs. "All in due time my dear, all in due time." He returns to his previous, more serious demeanor. "As [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|you]] may have noticed, we have a little [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Clear the Sky Moss\|Sky Moss]] related problem. I want you to solve that, but first I need to know if you're up for the task." #Character #Faction #Quest #Event
- I nod.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|He]] continues "So I want you to do [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Clear the Farms of Punching Onions\|something else]] for me first." He turns his gaze to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] and [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] "And rest assured, you will be well compensated for your endeavors." #Character #Quest #Event
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] grins "Good." #Character #Event
- "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Eckart\|I]] want [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|you]] to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Clear the Farms of Punching Onions\|clear a field of Onions]] near the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre/Narre's Farmfields\|outskirts of Narre]]. [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Bestiary/Plantlike/Punching Onion\|They]]…pack a punch. [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Hildegart\|Hildegart]] will give you the details. Report to me when you are done." Eckart turns around and walks upstairs. #Character #Faction #Quest #Location #Bestiary #Event
- The [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Hildegart\|gorilla]] gives [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|us]] the details. #Character #Faction #Event

- [[{05} Others/Templates/Resources/Tabletop/Party\|We]] head over to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre/Narre's Farmfields\|farms]]. The [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Narre/Farmers of Narre\|farmers]] point us to the field. "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Bestiary/Plantlike/Punching Onion\|Those Onions]] will pummel you if you're not careful." #Faction #Location #Bestiary #Event
- I nod. "They got this."
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] watch as [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] and [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] make quick work of the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Bestiary/Plantlike/Punching Onion\|Onions]]. #Character #Bestiary #Event
