- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] enter the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Tavern\|tavern]]. A [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|figure]] sits at a table, looking a bit desperate.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] walk up to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|the figure]]. "Hi, I'm [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|Lux]]. How are you?"
- "Leon. Terrible." The [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|figure]] responds. "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|Bandits]] in the woods nearby make it impossible to travel to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]]. Business has been down as a result. [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Bandits\|Can't travel as long as those monkeys are hiding there]]."
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] pull [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] and [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] from the bar. "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Bandits\|I found a quest]]."
- "How much does [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Bandits\|it]] pay?" [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] asks.
- "[[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|I]] can offer [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|you]] a free ride to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]]." [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|Leon]] states.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] walks back to the bar as [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] ponders. "A free ride and a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Leon\|potential ally]]. Hmm." [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] thinks out loud. "Alright. [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]]'ll see what we can do."

---

- Suddenly [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] barges in. "Guys, [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]] is sneaking out of town towards the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Forest\|woods]]."
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] quickly agree to tail [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|him]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] follow [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]] to the outskirts of [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden\|Opeden]]. Suddenly, he turns around and looks at us.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] quickly dash towards [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]]. "Hey Steven" I muster as innocently as I can. "I heard the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|bandits]] near [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]] were all supposedly monkeys. Have you heard anything about it?"
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]] shakes his head. "I have not. Anything else?"
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] shake my head, trying my best to convincingly look disappointed.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] back off and follow [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]] from a larger distance.

---

- After about an hour, [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]] suddenly dashes towards the bushes. [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] briefly wait before walking to the bushes.
- As [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|we]] move into the bushes, we can see a glimpse of [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]] meeting up with a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|group of monkeys]]. As [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]] walks into an [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Abandoned Windmill\|old, abandoned windmill]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] prepare to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Bandits\|confront]] the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|bandits]].

---

- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] flies up and dives towards the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|bandit in the back]]. [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] charges in as [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] notches an arrow.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] quickly fell most of the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|monkeys]]. The remaining monkeys are hiding in the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Abandoned Windmill\|windmill]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] barge inside, capturing the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|remaining monkeys]] including [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|Steven]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] tie up the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|monkeys]] and carry them back to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden\|Opeden]].

---

- As [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|we]] approach [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden\|Opeden]], we notice a cloud of [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Clear the Sky Moss\|Sky Moss]] hanging above the town. It appears to be slowly hovering towards the east, towards [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] hand over the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|bandits]] to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Hornwaldia Adventurer's Guild\|guild]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Arnoud\|Arnoud]] points [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|us]] to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Gourdlings\|another quest]]: a bunch of [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Bestiary/Plantlike/Gourdling\|Gourdlings]] are causing trouble to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Town Ruins\|north]].

---

- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] travel to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Town Ruins\|north]] to face the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Bestiary/Plantlike/Gourdling\|Gourdlings]].
- As [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|we]] approach the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Town Ruins\|ruins of a town]], we notice a field of [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Bestiary/Plantlike/Gourdling\|Gourdlings]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] swiftly [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Gourdlings\|strike down]] the animated [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Bestiary/Plantlike/Gourdling\|Gourdlings]] and return to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden\|Opeden]].

---

- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] report the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Gourdlings\|Defeat the Gourdlings]] to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Hornwaldia Adventurer's Guild\|Guild]]. The next day they promote us to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Red Level Guild Badge\|Red Level Guild Badge]].
