- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] heads to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Tavern\|tavern]] as the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|rest of the party]] heads to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Guild Building\|guild building]].

---

- As [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|we]] approach the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Guild Building\|guild building]] entrance, we are stopped by two guards: A [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Neutral/Peter\|gorilla]] and a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Enemies/Steven\|monkey]].
- The [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Neutral/Peter\|gorilla]] wants to see our [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Green Level Guild Badge\|badges]] before he allows entrance.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] show our [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Green Level Guild Badge\|Green Level Guild Badge]] to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Neutral/Peter\|gorilla]]. He denies us entrance to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Guild Building\|building]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] walk towards the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Tavern\|tavern]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Faction/Misc/Party\|We]] enter the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Opeden/Opeden Tavern\|tavern]]. Immediately we notice a ring where a gorilla and a bat are fighting. The bat quickly gets defeated by the way bigger opponent.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] looks at [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] and nods, and [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] nods back. Shortly after [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] enters the ring as [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] bets money on his victory.
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] see a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|bard]] in the corner and [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] at the bar. I walk up to [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]].
- "Did you get in?" [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] asks. "No," [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] respond. "We need [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Red Level Guild Badge\|a red badge]]."
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] order two beers and take them to the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|bard]] while [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] is scribbling [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Misc/Green Level Guild Badge\|something]] with his makeup.

---

- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] wait until the [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|bard]] is done with his story and hand him a beer. The [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|bard]] introduces himself as [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|Aleksi]], a story collector. [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Allies/Aleksi\|He]] informs me about a [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Quests/Completed/Defeat the Bandits\|quest regarding some monkey bandits]] on the road toward [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Location/Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]].
- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Lux\|I]] look back to the ring to see how the others are doing. [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Norrix\|Norrix]] seems to have defeated the gorilla spectacularly. Meanwhile [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Damjan\|Damjan]] is counting his returns on the bet.

---

- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Characters/Party/Morale\|Morale]] confesses stealing the quest.
