	- After a day we are near Straulach and decide to spend the night in the woods.
	- During the night Norrix and I hear some scraping noise from the south.
		- I sign Norrix to throw a knife as hard as possible towards the directions of the noise.
		- Norrix fumbles the throw.
		- I throw a knife and hit some wood.

	- The enemies open the doors to try to stop me.
- Norrix smacks on of the brown robe-wearing cultists
- Damjan tries to hit a cultist with his longsword.
- I pretend to have pried the bronze text from the statue by dropping my main guache on the ground and speaking the text extra poorly to annoy them.
