- The announcer announces that Norrix will be sacrificed tomorrow during the day of the Blood God.
- Damjan notices that there is no blood on him, despite his injuries. It is almost as if the floor absorbed all his blood.
- The announcers interviews Norrix while he is held at staff-point by a few mages.
- The arena slowly clears as the spectators exit the arena.
- Norrix notices the Arena Overseer has a big red necklace and a lot of medals. He seems proud. Next to him is a woman clad in white, bearing the insignia. I recognize it as the druid that got me the sleeping pills for my "grandma".
- We head to the tavern.
- I ask about the traditions and rituals around the sacrifice.
- The people in the tavern explain about the annual ritual of sacrifice to the Blood Stone. The Druidic ritual is required to prevent eternal night during the winter.
- We discuss our options regarding keeping Norrix alive.
- The leader of the Apothecary guild joins us in the tavern.
- He explains that he sees no options to help Norrix, because the guild has only been here for about a year.
- I ask about the worthiness earned in the Arena. The people explain that that has never happened.
- I head to the Druid leader with Damjan, while Norrix and Ravahn look for a potential victim to sacrifice.
- We meet with the lady that gave us the medicine earlier.
- !!Eckart is in Dottinghem!! He is heading to Hornbach to meet Kaisar buccicus, on the 11th. it is now the 3th.
- Damjan asks the druid woman about the rituals. She explains that yearly sacrifice prevents a winterlong night. The necromancer of the period of 'verderf' probably cursed the lands.
- Damjan asks if the curse can be broken.
- I ask about the risk involved with a single sacrifice.
- She is interrupted by another druid who explains that once a rigged tournament result was changed and another person was sacrificed.
- Norrix and Ravahn visit the slums, looking for a Norrix-like sacrifice.
- They spot a burly-looking Jackal, robbing a Weasel.
- Ravahn and Norrix offer him drugs.
- Ravahn offers him drugs for 3 denarii. He shakes the Weasel and pays up. He takes the pill and slowly walks away.
- Norrix shadows him. Eventually he collapses from the drug.
- I ask about the rituals. The Druid woman explains that the sacrifice will be prepared an hour in advance.
- **(+1 xp)**
- The party meets up at the tavern. We exchange the info on Eckart and the hostage to stand-in for Norrix.
- Norrix escapes in the dark of night.
- Ravahn keeps the hostage drugged during the night.
- The next morning they grab "Norrix". They clean him and prepare him for the sacrifice.
- We exit Wildt using a ferry and head to Hohrinzen. We arrive 5 hours later. The docker seems depressed. It is a small town with an Adventure Guild, Barber, Tavern, and a Great Vault.
- **(+3 xp)**
- 7 days till Hornbach.
