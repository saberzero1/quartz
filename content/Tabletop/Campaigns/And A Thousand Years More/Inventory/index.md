## Knowledge

- [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Notes/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] (!): The map has golden circles around Hornbach: the former Capital city and Cortvilly: the current Capital city, as well as a volcano. In addition it has two golden circles with no currently known towns. The circles are connected. I recognize that the points all align with Ley Lines, potentially allowing teleportation between them. The volcano also has a large cave system.


(!) is forbidden knowledge.
