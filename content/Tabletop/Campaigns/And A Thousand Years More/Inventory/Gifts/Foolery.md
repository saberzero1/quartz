> - [[Tabletop/Campaigns/And A Thousand Years More/Inventory/Gifts/Coward\|Coward]]

> [!DANGER] New stunt "*Taunt*"
> - As a stunt, you may *Taunt* another target. Your character insults the target, or performs rude gestures, or generally does something to the target to make them angry with you.
> 	- You may taunt even if this *Gift* is exhausted.
> 	- Taunting does not require you to have your mental faculties. You can *Taunt* even when *Confused* or *Enraged*.
> - Roll your *<mark class="hltr-purple">Mind</mark>* (`dice: 1d6`), *<mark class="hltr-aquamarine">Will</mark>* (`dice: 1d8`), and *<mark class="hltr-aquamarine">Presence</mark>* (`dice: 1d12+1d8+1d4`) dice.
> 	- The target rolls their *<mark class="hltr-aquamarine">Will</mark>*, *<mark class="hltr-aquamarine">Inquiry</mark>*, and your *Body* (`dice: 1d4`) Dice.
> 	- The target must be able to hear you.
> 		- You cannot be *Silenced*.
> 		- The target cannot be *Asleep* or *Unconscious*, etc.
> 	- *Range* penalties apply, but use *Cover* and *Concealment* on *yourself*, not the target.
> 		- (Taunting works better if you're out in the open.)
> - **No successes**: Nothing happens.
> - **One success**: The target becomes *Enraged* if they can become *Enraged* (Not *Afraid*, etc.).
> 	- *Enranged* characters must take the "*<mark class="hltr-orange">Attack</mark>*" action every round.
> - **Two successes**: The target becomes *Enraged*.
> 	- Negates any conditions that prevent the target from becoming *Enraged*.
> - **Three successes or more**: The target becomes *Berserk*.
> 	- Negates any conditions that prevent the target from becoming *Berserk*.
