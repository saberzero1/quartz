I acquired an exquisite set of attire from the renowned tailor of Narre - a set of garments crafted to disguise me with the utmost finesse, allowing me to blend into the bustling throng of people as if I had always been a part of them. The exquisite craftsmanship of the tailor was evident in the way the fine fabrics clung to my body, giving me the perfect disguise and a seamless integration into the common folk.
