> [!question]- Homebrew Goals
> This homebrew aims to keep a character's combat stats and social stats somewhat seperate. This allows for more freedom in roleplay options even when a character's combat stats are different from their backstory.
>
> For example:
> - A burly barbarian might enjoy philosophy, thus having advantage on history checks despite a low intelligence score.
> - A young rogue might be great with animals despite a low wisdom score, granting it a bonus to animal handling.
> - A character that is an experienced gambler might have a low dexterity score, but still have expertise in sleight of hand checks related to gambling or rigging a bet.

Roleplay Abilities grant powerful and specialized boons to characters to use in social situations, allowing characters to mix-and-match their combat gameplay and roleplay gameplay more freely.
