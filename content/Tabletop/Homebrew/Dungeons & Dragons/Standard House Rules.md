> [!abstract]- Brief Overview
> - **[[Tabletop/Homebrew/Dungeons & Dragons/Rule of Cool\|Rule of Cool]]** (Especially great ideas (or especially terrible ones) that allow for unexpected twists and entertaining possibilities are rewarded with bonuses such as easier rolls, advantage on rolls, or even allowing characters to make things happen that would normally be nearly impossible.)
> - **[[Tabletop/Homebrew/Dungeons & Dragons/Roleplay Abilities\|Roleplay Abilities]]** (In addition to combat abilities, every player has a set of roleplay abilities to allow further customization and not limit player social contributions to roleplay based on their character build.)
> - **[[Tabletop/Homebrew/Dungeons & Dragons/Allied Parties Attack Simultaneously\|Allied Parties Attack Simultaneously]]** (all party members/allies/enemies move simultaneously, allowing for more strategic interaction between players.)
> - **[[Tabletop/Homebrew/Dungeons & Dragons/Influential Roleplay\|Influential Roleplay]]** (DM can asks for roleplay performance rather than dice roll. Satisfactory roleplay always succeeds. Gives the player the option to sway the outcome based on roleplay, potentially resulting in something more beneficial than a dice roll could allow. Promotes roleplay.)
> - **[[Tabletop/Homebrew/Dungeons & Dragons/Reckless Inspiration\|Reckless Inspiration]]** (Every player starts every session with an inspiration coin. They can use this coin to gain advantage on any d20 roll they make. After doing so, the coin is flipped to the other side. When flipped, the DM can decide to gain advantage against the player on a single d20 roll against them. Afterwards they flip the coin again and regain the ability to use inspiriation. While thee coin is available for the DM, The player can regain inspiration by great roleplay, allowing them to regain Reckless Inspiration without the DM using it to gain advantage against them.)

## Reasoning:

Game should be fun. (duh)

Player interaction, teamworking, and strategizing create fun. These house rules aim to increase player satisfaction by:

- Increasing player agency
- Rewarding clever and entertaining roleplay and teamwork
- Reducing the roleplay limitations often imposed by class based build by separating combat and social abilities.
