As Humanity walked up the mountain, it came across circular temple. The temple was called 'Virtues'. The temple consisted of ten pillars, upon which stood ten figures, one on every pillar. Humanity walked to the center of the temple and knelt.

Then the Satan appeared. "Welcome, Humanity, to the temple of Virtues. You are welcome to pick any one virtue, and it will be granted to you."

Humanity looked around the temple. Every pillar was engraved with a virtue: Knowledge, Wisdom, Courage, Faith, Creativity, Honor, Judgement, Patience, Wit, and Generosity.

Humanity asked the virtues: "Which one of you is the greatest virtue in God's eyes?"

Wit responded first. "What good are the other virtues, if you cannot pronounce them? Wit is like a sharp tongue. Without a tongue, one cannot speak."

Courage answered next. "How can you be virtuous, if you are not upstanding? Courage is like an upright spine, without one you can only bow before your fears."

Up next was Knowledge. "If you choose me, you would have all the Knowledge you need to find God. Only a bright mind can shine light into the darkness."

Creativity responded. "If you havenÂ´t found God, you need to get more creative. Like an eloquent voice, Creativity will always tell you the way."

Faith answered. "How would you find God without having having Faith? Like a devoted spirit, you need Faith to believe in what is Highest to find it."

Judgement was next. "Without Judgement, how could know if you have found God? Like a keen eye, you need Judgement to see what is God and what is not."

Honor remarked. "How would you find God without Honor? Like a steadfast shoulder, you need Honor to bear the burden of your search."

Wisdom stated "If you had Wisdom, you would know how to find God, and how to not find God. A discerning heart is all you need."

Generosity said. "Your God is a generous God. Like Him, you too should reach out with a benevolent hand in Generosity. Otherwise you will never find Him"

Last was Patience. "As I have waited and listened, like a sincere ear, so too you should you listen. For in Patience you shall find what you're looking for."

Then the Satan walked up and asked Humanity "What virtue will you choose?"

Then Humanity bowed down and prayed. "God, teach me what is most virtuous in your eyes. For only you know the answer I seek."

In response to the prayer, a roaring thunder sounded from the Heavens above as God spoke to Humanity.

"Notice how our pillars are all the same height." God stated. "None is greater than the other, yet all are raised above the ground. After all, Knowledge without Wisdom is as water in the sand. Courage without Faith is rashness. Wit without Generosity becomes boastful. Judgement without Patience turns tyrannical. Creativity without Honor becomes vanity. <!--Only together they can support a virtuous existence.-->"

Then Humanity opened their eyes, and realized they were now standing on a pillar towering above the others. Humanity was standing on the pillar of integrity.

The same voice spoke from the heavens. "Blessed are the pure at heart, for they shall see God."

Then humanity left the temple, having learned prayer, and Humanity continued up the mountain.
