- Constantine Kison's speech at Oxford Union gained 100-200 million views.
- Adults need to challenge young people to be better and not pander to their preconceived beliefs.

[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=383) The limits to growth model is hypocritical and wrong technically.

- The poor cannot care about long-term sustainability as they are busy trying to survive.
- Improving poverty is the best policy to produce a sustainable planet.

[18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=1092) The human vision is apocalyptic and we need a place to put the apocalypse.

- The Doomsday narrative maps well onto wilderness.
- We are tilted towards hyper processing negative information.

[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=38) Young people need a positive vision for the future

- Conservatives struggle with this because they want to suppress rebellion
- Young people need a path to doing things to learn trade-offs and limitations

[34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=2077) Develop a vision for life that includes intimate relationships, family, career, education, and self-care.

- Intimate relationships, family, and children are important for most people.
- Regulate behavior in relation to temptations like drug and alcohol abuse and sex.
- Take care of yourself mentally and physically.
- Have an educational plan to learn and get better at something.
- Make productive and generous use of your free time.
- Developing a vision on these fronts is highly motivating and unites people psychologically.
- Bad religions take many forms, and woke religion is a bad one that doesn't offer a route for redemption or atonement.
- Other religions offer a route for redemption and atonement.

[40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=2405) Healthy religion offers a pathway to atonement and rectification of inadequacy.

- Confession in Catholicism is a form of God's mercy manifested in the world.
- A fundamental set of beliefs in a healthy religion is a pathway forward to the rectification of inadequacy and flaw.

[51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=3118) Trusting intuition requires integration of guiding principles.

- Intuition can guide towards beauty, truth, lust, envy, or hunger.
- Elevating intuition to the highest place is functionally equivalent to God.

[57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=3456) The Greek notion of logos was that there was an intrinsic order to the material world.

- Consulting intuition requires admitting a problem and being open to correction.
- The human being is a microcosm that reflects the macrocosm and reveals intuitions that will move you forward.

[1:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=4105) Organized social units can degenerate into tyranny, but that doesn't mean it's their central animating spirit.

- Sam Harris is concerned with the problem of evil and wants to establish an objective morality.
- Religion is useful, but one shouldn't submit arbitrarily to a rigid structure. Covenantal relationship is actually a negotiation, not submission.

[1:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=4454) The need for a transcendental experience to agree on truth and the usefulness of religion in uniting people.

- The dangers of Catholicism and Protestantism.
- The problem with identity politics and the need for intermediary structures to unite people.

[1:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=5133) The underlying meta principle unites coherent principles.

- Christ's principle of loving God and others is the meta principle upon which all Commandments rest.
- The monotheistic tendency tilts towards putting the Divine above all else, uniting us with others.

[1:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=5468) A positive vision is needed to avoid becoming the abyss we've been staring into.

- Pointing fingers at the woke and saying they're becoming deranged makes us deranged.
- Censorship is not the answer to the problem of the woke miasma and has to be battled out in the realm of ideas.

[1:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpUFLD_xlw&t=6496) The world needs a positive vision of the future

- Current methods are not solving problems
- A new and radical solution is necessary

## Excerpt

Dr Jordan B Peterson and Konstantin Kisin discuss western privilege, the self, the nature of God and religion, the necessity of religion for morality, and how we must combat the death of truth with cohesive principles.

He is also the author of “An Immigrant's Love Letter to the West,” a Sunday Times Bestseller. He has written for several publications including Quillette, The Spectator, The Daily Telegraph, and Standpoint on issues relating to tech censorship, woke culture, comedy, and other topics, but currently publishes articles on his popular Substack.

His speech at the debate received viral attention and has been seen by over 100 million people around the world.
