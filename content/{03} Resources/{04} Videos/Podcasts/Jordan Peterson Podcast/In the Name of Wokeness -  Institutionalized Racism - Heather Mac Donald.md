## Summary

The discussion consists of two parts. The first part is a spoken word segment with various topics, and the second part is a technical description of developing hiring criteria for a job.

Detailed Summary for [In the Name of Wokeness: Institutionalized Racism | Heather Mac Donald | EP 350](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=0) Merit is the ranking of people in relation to their ability to perform the tasks of a given job, and can be assessed most accurately by tests of general cognitive ability.

- Tests of general cognitive ability are good predictors of performance in complex jobs
- Throwing out cognitive test literature because it produces disparate racial impact is not a good idea
- Heather McDonald's book "When Race Trumps Merit" focuses on how group identity can trump merit in various fields

[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=467) Objective tests of merit are not racist and have allowed society to discover hidden talent.

- The use of cognitive tests did not have an ulterior motive of keeping out blacks.
- Leftists either believe these tests are covertly racist or do not believe in ideas of merit or accomplishment.
- If they believe these tests are invalid, they should go to randomized admissions by lottery.

[21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=1295) The vast range of human cognitive ability makes itself manifest in a rather arbitrary fashion.

- People with an IQ of less than 83 cannot be trained to do anything of any utility at any level of military organization.
- There is an immense diversity in capacity built in at the beginning, which brings a tremendous advantage.
- A lot of this discourse is driven by race, and there would not be much upset about cognitive testing if there were no significant IQ gaps between blacks and whites.

[28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=1699) Race plays a significant role in mass incarceration and cognitive disparities.

- In the US, a three percent chance of being imprisoned means most crimes go unpunished.
- Racial disparities in prison population exist, with blacks being about a third despite being 13% of the population.
- Environmental intermediation can improve cognitive ability, with the Flynn effect showing changes in IQ scores over time.
- Racial gaps in cognitive ability performance decrease with age, with a smaller difference observed in childhood.
- Further investigation is needed to determine why the gap expands across time, with factors like fatherlessness and early literacy potentially playing a role.

[41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=2485) Fatherlessness could have a significant impact on cognitive development and social stability.

- The lack of a father figure can impact puberty and genetic differences in children.
- The breakdown of familial structure has led to a catastrophic increase in the out-of-wedlock birth rate for Blacks.
- Children growing up in single-parent households are more likely to be poor and have lower cognitive development.
- The problem of single parenting extends beyond the individual child to cultural expectations that can hinder male development.

[48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=2885) Developing self-control and future orientation is crucial for success.

- Without developing such skills, it is difficult to be a plausible worker, husband, or colleague.
- Depriving people of responsibility can be self-destructive and lead to a lifestyle that is unsustainable.
- The key to success is passing on social capital and bourgeois values.

[1:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=3657) Conscientiousness is the second best predictor of long-term economic success; there is no evidence of intrinsic ethnic differences in conscientiousness.

- Asian families excel at instilling conscientious virtues and their children perform better academically in the US.
- The inculcation of conscientious virtues may help remediate racial differences in outcomes.
- The development of a school unrelenting in its emphasis on self-discipline could be a second-best solution to the problem.
- The Michaela School in inner-city London adopts an extraordinarily disciplined approach and has graduates with a higher chance of being accepted to top UK universities.

[1:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=4052) The perils of the Equity Doctrine

- Leftist institutions are pushing the Equity Doctrine, which brands any institution lacking proportional representation of blacks as racist
- The doctrine is flawed as it assumes that any racial disparity is caused by racism and disregards meritocratic standards

[1:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=4899) Academic diversity, equity, and inclusion statements are limiting scientific progress

- The lottery system for admissions at Thomas Jefferson School had negative consequences
- Scientists are being evaluated based on their equity work instead of their intellectual capacity

[1:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkXJojxSE0U&t=6123) Feminization of modern institutions is a complete disaster.

- Universities are making people anxious and depressed at a rapid rate.
- Females are more inclined towards safety values, less interested in ideas and logical reasoning.
