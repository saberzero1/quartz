This Fruit Bat Bard was a mysterious figure that followed the party of adventurers, always seeking new stories to tell. He was first encountered in the Opeden Tavern, wearing a striking cape made of rare sky moss that shimmered in the firelight. He had a keen eye and ear for the tales of ancient lore, and with a twinkle in his eye he would always promise to pay the teller with a song.
