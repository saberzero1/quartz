After liberating Narre from her captors, Eckart quickly fled the scene, leaving behind a set of maps that unfurled a mysterious location deep in the heart of the dark and foreboding woods. It seemed likely that he was hiding there, biding his time in the shadows. As the heroes prepared themselves for the journey ahead, they knew not what perils or wonders awaited them in the deep, but they were determined to find out.
