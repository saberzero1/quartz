- [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{01} Misc/Party\|We]] enter the [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{02} Location/{01} Towns and Cities/{01} Landmarks/{01} Opeden/Opeden Tavern\|tavern]]. A [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Leon\|figure]] sits at a table, looking a bit desperate. #Character #Faction #Location #Event
- I walk up to the figure. "Hi, I'm Lux. How are you?"
- "Leon. Terrible." The [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Leon\|figure]] responds. "[[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{02} Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|Bandits]] in the woods nearby make it impossible to travel to Narre. Business has been down as a result. [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{03} Projects/{03} Quest/{02} Completed/Defeat the Bandits\|Can't travel as long as those monkeys are hiding there]]." #Character #Faction #Quest #Event
- I pull Damjan and Norrix from the bar. "I found a quest."
- "How much does it pay?" Norrix asks.
- "I can offer you a free ride to [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{02} Location/{01} Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]]." [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Leon\|Leon]] states. #Character #Location #Event
- Norrix walks back to the bar as Damjan ponders. "A free ride and a potential ally. Hmm." Damjan thinks out loud. "Alright. We'll see what we can do."

- Suddenly [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{03} Graveyard/Morale\|Morale]] barges in. "Guys, [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Steven\|Steven]] is sneaking out of town towards the [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{02} Location/{01} Towns and Cities/{01} Landmarks/{01} Opeden/Opeden Forest\|woods]]." #Character #Location #Event
- [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{01} Misc/Party\|We]] quickly agree to tail [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Steven\|him]]. #Character #Faction #Event
- [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{01} Misc/Party\|We]] follow [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Steven\|Steven]] to the outskirts of [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{02} Location/{01} Towns and Cities/Opeden\|Opeden]]. Suddenly, he turns around and looks at us. #Character #Faction #Location #Event
- [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{01} Party/Lux\|I]] quickly dash towards [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Steven\|Steven]]. "Hey Steven" I muster as innocently as I can. "I heard the [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{02} Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|bandits]] near [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{02} Location/{01} Towns and Cities/Narre\|Narre]] were all supposedly monkeys. Have you heard anything about it?" #Character #Faction #Location #Event
- Steven shakes his head. "I have not. Anything else?"
- I shake my head, trying my best to convincingly look disappointed.
- [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{01} Misc/Party\|We]] back off and follow [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Steven\|Steven]] from a larger distance. #Character #Faction #Event

- After about an hour, [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Steven\|Steven]] suddenly dashes towards the bushes. [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{01} Misc/Party\|We]] briefly wait before walking to the bushes. #Character #Event
- As [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{01} Misc/Party\|we]] move into the bushes, we can see a glimpse of [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{01} Characters/{02} NPC/Steven\|Steven]] meeting up with a [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{02} Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|group of monkeys]].

- Morale flies up and dives towards the bandit in the back. Norrix charges in as Damjan notches an arrow.
- [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{01} Misc/Party\|We]] quickly fell most of the [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{03} Faction/{02} Opeden/Bandits of Opeden\|monkeys]]. The remaining monkeys are hiding in the [[{06} Spaces/{03} IronClaw/{02} Areas/{02} Location/{01} Towns and Cities/{01} Landmarks/{01} Opeden/Abandoned Windmill\|windmill]]. #Faction #Location
