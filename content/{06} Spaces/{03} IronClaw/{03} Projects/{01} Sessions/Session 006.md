The party and Imtrud gather around.

"We need a plan." I whisper "If we want to take down the tower."

We discuss it for a few minutes.

Suddenly we hear coughing as if someone is trying to get our attention.

We look towards the entrance and see a figure that shouldn't be here: Master Eckart.

"Why are you here?" Norrix states as he clutches his mace.

"I detected very low brain activity, so I came to investigate." Eckart snidely remarks.

"I'm going to give you low brain activity if you don't shut up you second-rate magician." Imtrud snarls.

A fight breaks out.

Both sides fight hard, but we ultimately provail thanks to Damjan's and Norrix's combined firepower with support from Ravann and myself.

---

As we defeat the last of Eckart minions, he begins to flee. We give chase.
