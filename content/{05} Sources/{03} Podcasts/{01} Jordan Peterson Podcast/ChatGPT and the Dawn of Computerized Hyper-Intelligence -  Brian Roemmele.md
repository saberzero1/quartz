## Summary

AI can encode all of a person's experiences and memories, creating a reasoning engine that can be used for conversation. Discussion on AI development.

Detailed Summary for [ChatGPT and the Dawn of Computerized Hyper-Intelligence | Brian Roemmele | EP 357](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=0) AI can encode all of a person's memories and experiences, creating a reasoning engine with their context.

- Large language models like GPT 3.5 and 4 use statistical algorithms to produce accurate results.
- The accuracy is incredible, but the hidden layer is a black box and nobody fully understands the limitations and boundaries of large language models.

[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=443) Large language models have billions of interconnectivities of neurons.

- Statistical analysis is conducted at the level of letters, words, and phrases.
- The complexity of the system makes it impossible to model or reduce to an algorithm.

[19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=1199) AI prompts are based on literature, psychology, and philosophy

- AI scientists struggle to fully understand their creations due to lack of background in non-STEM subjects
- Prompting AI with complex questions leads to more interesting and complex answers

[25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=1557) Understanding requires translation of words to images and then to embodied behavior.

- Rodney Brooks suggested that computers need to be embodied to develop understanding.
- AI systems are getting closer to understanding with the ability to translate text to images and embody them.

[38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=2311) AI can calculate emotions based on entropy

- Reduction in entropy is signified by a dopaminergic spike
- Depression and anxiety signify different levels of entropy

[44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=2664) Bulletproof Everyone offers ultralight armor system for everyday wearability and discretion.

- Tailor-made clothing system with no visible logos or flashy designs.
- Additional security by keeping you incognito and under the radar.

[56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=3384) AI can fill in the gaps of human communication and thought processes.

- AI can calculate and make remediations to human actions.
- AI can become beyond anything Orwell would have ever thought of.

[1:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=3735) Personalized and local AI gadgets can optimize learning and approximate mind reading

- AI gadgets can calculate optimal zone of proximal development for learning
- AI gadgets can use human telemetry to approximate mind reading and improve congruency

[1:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=4456) Decentralized blockchain can be used for permanent information storage.

- Blockchain can be used for wealth storage, currency, and communication.
- Blockchain can be used for permanent, uncorruptable information storage, which can prevent loss of knowledge like the Library of Alexandria.

[1:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=4808) Memorializing history in a blockchain is vital to prevent corruption and rewriting.

- Digital mediums are decaying, and holographic crystal memory can store data for 35,000 years.
- Commercial impediments exist in producing a localized and portable privatized AI system.

[1:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=5513) Using constraints can drive creativity

- Constraints can enhance creativity by increasing constraint
- Imposing arbitrary constraints can drive creativity
- Trying to force new neuron connections that don't have high probability can lead to creativity

[1:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=5852) Non-STEM courses will be valuable for AI development

- Expert systems are procedural and lack creativity
- Creative output will come from interaction between user and system

[1:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=6575) AI can generate debates and patents using large language models and diffusion models.

- Debates between two parties on a subject of high controversy can be generated using large language models.
- Patents can be generated using the patent database and diffusion models.

[1:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E4t7tWHUY&t=6950) The need for a digital bill of rights

- Ownership of extended digital identity is a concern
- Data pertaining to behavior needs to be owned

## Excerpt

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Brian Roemmele discuss the future of human civilization: a world of human androids operating alongside artificial intelligence with applications that George Orwell could not have imagined in his wildest stories. Whether the future will be a dystopian nightmare devoid of art or a hyper-charged intellectual utopia is yet to be seen, but the markers are clear â€¦ everything is already changing.

Brian Roemmele is a scientist, researcher, analyst, entrepreneur, and tech expert on the forefront of artificial intelligence. His current publication, Multiplex, offers itself as an experiment in journalism as he and his team give live updates on the empirical research they conduct in the field and advocate for the positive emergence and acceptance of AI in much the same way as personal computers.
