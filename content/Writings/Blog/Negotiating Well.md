## Black Swan Method

- Questions, not to get answers, but to invoke thoughts in the other party. For example, during a job interview:
	- What happens if you guys don't fulfill this role?
	- How can I be most successful for you?
	- How can I begin to be involved in project that are critical to the strategic future of this organisation.
	- (How am I supposed to accept a salary of half of what I'm worth.)
- Why?
	- Your other options don't change your value to the company AND don't change their ability to pay you.
	- You should be working WITH your boss and vise versa.
- If you ask a question you should mean it.
	- This means you both want to know the answer, and are willing to listen carefully to the person who asks the question.

## Loving what you do/Having an aim

- Most meaning comes from adopting voluntary responsibility.
	- If you don't adopt voluntary responsibility, some involuntary responsibility will be forced upon you.
		- You have to adopt responsibility. If you don't, some involuntary responsibility will inevitably be thrust upon you.
- Ask yourself: why do you want a job when you go for a job interview?
	- Beside paying next month's rent. Which is still perfectly valid, but it will not make you a compelling enough interviewee. It is too shallow.
		- It shows you haven't thought it through enough.
- You can have what you want, but you have to specify what it is.
	- People generally do not do this, because they might feel like they are betraying themselves.
	- If you have a job interview that goes well and it turn into a discussion. If you have a vision for your own life, then you can see if this job will work for you.
		- This will turn the job interview into a negotiation. Because you want the job, and ideally, they also want you.
			- **This is ultimately the goal of the job interview: establishing the preconditions for collaboration.**
	- When in a job interview: **Make sure you know what job your applying for.**
		- If you don't, then you might as well not be there in the first place. Because if you don't know, what will you add to the company?

## Importance of listening

- Listening is not only about what is said, but also how it is said.
- A 'change of heart' is much more effective if you decide to have that change of heart, instead of someone forcing it down your throat.
	- Voluntary acceptance vs involuntary compliance, if you will.
	- You want an agreement to last, without either party having to check daily.
		- Micromanage if you will.
	- People become micromanagers for one of two reasons:
		- Their personality happens to be like that.
		- They negotiated a deal that the other party is not thrilled about and they have to micromanage to ensure the other party actually does what they want.
	- Neither case is desirable.
- You should be able to summarize what the other person has said.
- **Voluntary agreement is the best basis for an optimal relationship.**

## The basis of software development

- When you build a product for a customer, you don't just build it.
	- You build a bit of it, and discuss if it solves the problem the customer is facing.
		- If it does, keep going.
		- If it doesn't, change it to better fit the requirements.
	- This, in principle, is what [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is.
		- Iterable development is not much different than having a relationship.
			- You talk and listen. You act upon it. You talk and listen some more.
